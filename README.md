## Code Overview
The main functionality is implemented in `MainActivity.java`, where:
- Buttons are initialized and assigned click listeners.
- Arithmetic operations are handled.
- The result is displayed in a `TextView` component.

### Testing
The project includes unit testing using JUnit. The `ExampleUnitTest.java` file contains test cases to validate basic arithmetic operations. For example:
- The `addition_isCorrect()` test checks if the addition operation is functioning correctly by asserting `2 + 2 = 4`.

1. Open the `ExampleUnitTest.java` file.
2. Click the `Run` button next to the test method.
3. View test results in the `Run` window.
